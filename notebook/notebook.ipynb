       " '1.1: Basic Definitions and Concepts To learn the basic definitions used in statistics and some of its key concepts. We begin with a simple example. There are millions of passenger automobiles in the United States. What is their average value? It is obviously impractical to attempt to solve this problem directly by assessing the value of every single car in the country, add up all those values, then divide by the number of values, one for each car. In practice the best we can do would be to estimate the average value. A natural way to do so would be to randomly select some of the cars, say of them, ascertain the value of each of those cars, and find the average of those values. The set of all those millions of vehicles is called the population of interest, and the number attached to each one, its value, is a measurement. The average value is a parameter: a number that describes a characteristic of the population, in this case monetary worth. The set of cars selected from the population is called a sample, and the numbers, the monetary values of the cars we selected, are the sample data. The average of the data is called a statistic: a number calculated from the sample data. This example illustrates the meaning of the following definitions. A population is any specific collection of objects of interest. A sample is any subset or subcollection of the population, including the case that the sample consists of the whole population, in which case it is termed a census. A measurement is a number or attribute computed for each member of a population or of a sample. The measurements of sample elements are collectively called the sample data. A parameter is a number that summarizes some aspect of the population as a whole. A statistic is a number computed from the sample data. Continuing with our example, if the average value of the cars in our sample was , then it seems reasonable to conclude that the average value of all cars is about . In reasoning this way we have drawn an inference about the population based on information obtained from the sample. In general, statistics is a study of data: describing properties of the data, which is called descriptive statistics, and drawing conclusions about a population of interest from information extracted from a sample, which is called inferential statistics. Computing the single number to summarize the data was an operation of descriptive statistics; using it to make a statement about the population was an operation of inferential statistics. Statistics is a collection of methods for collecting, displaying, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data. Descriptive statistics is the branch of statistics that involves organizing, displaying, and describing data. Inferential statistics is the branch of statistics that involves drawing conclusions about a population based on information contained in a sample taken from that population. The measurement made on each element of a sample need not be numerical. In the case of automobiles, what is noted about each car could be its color, its make, its body type, and so on. Such data are categorical or qualitative, as opposed to numerical or quantitative data such as value or age. This is a general distinction.

       " 'Qualitative data are measurements for which there is no natural numerical scale, but which consist of attributes, labels, or other non-numerical characteristics. Quantitative data are numerical measurements that arise from a natural numerical scale. Qualitative data can generate numerical sample statistics. In the automobile example, for instance, we might be interested in the proportion of all cars that are less than six years old. In our same sample of cars we could note for each car whether it is less than six years old or not, which is a qualitative measurement. If cars in the sample are less than six years old, which is or , then we would estimate the parameter of interest, the population proportion, to be about the same as the sample statistic, the sample proportion, that is, about . The relationship between a population of interest and a sample drawn from that population is perhaps the most important concept in statistics, since everything else rests on it. This relationship is illustrated graphically in Figure . The circles in the large box represent elements of the population. In the figure there was room for only a small number of them but in actual situations, like our automobile example, they could very well number in the millions. The solid black circles represent the elements of the population that are selected at random and that together form the sample. For each element of the sample there is a measurement of interest, denoted by a lower case (which we have indexed as to tell them apart); these measurements collectively form the sample data set. From the data we may calculate various statistics. To anticipate the notation that will be used later, we might compute the sample mean and the sample proportion , and take them as approximations to the population mean (this is the lower case Greek letter mu, the traditional symbol for this parameter) and the population proportion , respectively. The other symbols in the figure stand for other parameters and statistics that we will encounter.

       " 'Statistics is a study of data: describing properties of data (descriptive statistics) and drawing conclusions about a population based on information in a sample (inferential statistics). The distinction between a population together with its parameters and a sample together with its statistics is a fundamental concept in inferential statistics. Information in a sample is used to make inferences about the population from which the sample was drawn.

       " '1.2: Overview To obtain an overview of the material in the text. The example we gave in the first section seems fairly simple, but it illustrates some significant problems. We supposed that the cars of the sample had an average value of (a number that is precisely known), and concluded that the population has an average of about the same amount, although its precise value is still unknown. What would happen if someone else were to take another sample of exactly the same size from exactly the same population? Would he or she get the same sample average as we did, ? Almost surely not. In fact, if the investigator who took the second sample reported precisely the same value, we would immediately become suspicious of his result. The sample average is an example of what is called a random variable: a number that varies from trial to trial of an experiment (in this case, from sample to sample), and does so in a way that cannot be predicted precisely. Random variables will be a central object of study for us, beginning in Chapter 4. Another issue that arises is that different samples have different levels of reliability. We have supposed that our sample of size had an average of . If a sample of size yielded an average value of , then we would naturally regard this latter number as probably a better estimate of the average value of all cars, since it came from a larger sample. How can this be expressed? An important idea developed in Chapter 7 is the confidence interval: from the data we will construct an interval of values using a process that has a certain chance, say a chance, of generating an interval that contains the true population average. Thus, instead of reporting a single estimate, , for the population mean we might say that, based on our sample data, we are certain that the true average is within of our sample mean, that is, we are certain that the true average is the between and . The number will be computed from the sample data just as the sample mean was. This \" confidence interval\" will automatically indicate the reliability of the estimate that we obtained from the sample. Moreover, to obtain the same chance of containing the unknown parameter, a large sample will typically produce a shorter interval than a small sample will. Thus large samples usually give more accurate results. Unless we perform a census, which is a \"sample\" that includes the entire population, we can never be completely sure of the exact average value of the population. The best that we can do is to make statements of probability, an important concept that we will begin to study formally in Chapter 3. Sampling may be done not only to estimate a population parameter, but to test a claim that is made about that parameter. Suppose a food package asserts that the amount of sugar in one serving of the product is grams. A consumer group might suspect that it actually contains more. How would they test the competing claims about the amount of sugar, \" grams\" versus \"more than grams\"? They might take a random sample of perhaps food packages, measure the amount of sugar in one serving of each one, and average those amounts. They are not interested in measuring the average amount of sugar in a serving for its own sake; their interest is simply whether the claim about the true amount is accurate. Stated another way, they are sampling not in order to estimate the average amount of sugar in one serving, but to see whether that amount, whatever it may be, is larger than grams. Again because one can have certain knowledge only by taking a census, ideas of probability enter into the analysis. We will examine tests of hypotheses beginning in Chapter 8 . Several times in this introduction we have used the term  random sample.  Generally the value of our data is only as good as the sample that produced it. For example, suppose we wish to estimate the proportion of all students at a large university who are females, which we denote by . If we select students at random and of them are female, then a natural estimate is or . How much confidence we can place in this estimate depends not only on the size of the sample, but on its quality, whether or not it is truly random, or at least truly representative of the whole population. If all students in our sample were drawn from a College of Nursing, then the proportion of female students in the sample is likely higher than that of the entire campus. If all students were selected from a College of Engineering Sciences, then the proportion of students in the entire student body who are females could be underestimated. In either case, the estimate would be distorted or biased. In statistical practice an unbiased sampling scheme is important but in most cases not easy to produce. For this introductory course we will assume that all samples are either random or at least representative. Statistics computed from samples vary randomly from sample to sample. Conclusions made about population parameters are statements of probability.

       " '1.3: Presentation of Data To learn two ways that data will be presented in the text. In this book we will use two formats for presenting data sets. The first is a data list, which is an explicit listing of all the individual measurements, either as a display with space between the individual measurements, or in set notation with individual measurements separated by commas. The data obtained by measuring the age of randomly selected students enrolled in freshman courses at a university could be presented as the data list: or in set notation as: A data set can also be presented by means of a data frequency table, a table in which each distinct value is listed in the first row and its frequency , which is the number of times the value appears in the data set, is listed below it in the second row. A data set can also be presented by means of a data frequency table, a table in which each distinct value is listed in the first row and its frequency , which is the number of times the value appears in the data set, is listed below it in the second row. The data set of the previous example is represented by the data frequency table The data frequency table is especially convenient when data sets are large and the number of distinct values is not too large. Data sets can be presented either by listing all the elements or by giving a table of values and frequencies.

       " \"CHAPTER OVERVIEW 2: Descriptive Statistics Statistics naturally divides into two branches, descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. Our main interest is in inferential statistics to try to infer from the data what the population might thin or to evaluate the probability that an observed difference between groups is a dependable one or one that might have happened by chance in this study. Nevertheless, the starting point for dealing with a collection of data is to organize, display, and summarize it effectively. These are the objectives of descriptive statistics, the topic of this chapter. 2.1: Three Popular Data Displays 2.2: Measures of Central Location - Three Kinds of Averages 2.3: Measures of Variability 2.4: Relative Position of Data 2.5: The Empirical Rule and Chebyshev's Theorem 2.E: Descriptive Statistics (Exercises) This page titled 2: Descriptive Statistics is shared under a CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Anonymous via source content that was edited to the style and standards of the LibreTexts platform. \",\n",
       " '2.1: Three Popular Data Displays To learn to interpret the meaning of three graphical representations of sets of data: stem and leaf diagrams, frequency histograms, and relative frequency histograms. A well-known adage is that  a picture is worth a thousand words.  This saying proves true when it comes to presenting statistical information in a data set. There are many effective ways to present data graphically. The three graphical tools that are introduced in this section are among the most commonly used and are relevant to the subsequent presentation of the material in this book. Stem and Leaf Diagrams Suppose students in a statistics class took a test and made the following scores: How did the class do on the test? A quick glance at the set of numbers does not immediately give a clear answer. However the data set may be reorganized and rewritten to make relevant information more visible. One way to do so is to construct a stem and leaf diagram as shown in Figure The numbers in the tens place, from through , and additionally the number , are the  stems,  and are arranged in numerical order from top to bottom to the left of a vertical line. The number in the units place in each measurement is a  leaf,  and is placed in a row to the right of the corresponding stem, the number in the tens place of that measurement. Thus the three leaves in the row headed with the stem correspond to the three exam scores in the (in the first row of data), (in the third row), and (also in the third row). Figure : Stem and Leaf Diagram The display is made even more useful for some purposes by rearranging the leaves in numerical order, as shown in Figure . Either way, with the data reorganized certain information of interest becomes apparent immediately. There are two perfect scores; three students made scores under ; most students scored in the ; and the overall average is probably in the high . Figure : Ordered Stem and Leaf Diagram In this example the scores have a natural stem (the tens place) and leaf (the ones place). One could spread the diagram out by splitting each tens place number into lower and upper categories. For example, all the scores in the may be represented on two separate stems, lower and upper :  Learning Objectives 30 86 90 40 80 83 58 25 70 68 77 73 69 73 73 100 76 70 78 100 90 87 90 83 97 69 71 92 93 95 74 30 2.1.1 2 9 10 9, 8, and 9 6 60s, 69 68 69 2.1.1 2.1.2 60 70s, 80s and 90s 70s or low 80s 2.1.2 80s 80s 80s ',\n",
       " 'The definitions of stems and leaves are flexible in practice. The general purpose of a stem and leaf diagram is to provide a quick display of how the data are distributed across the range of their values; some improvisation could be necessary to obtain a diagram that best meets that goal. Note that all of the original data can be recovered from the stem and leaf diagram. This will not be true in the next two types of graphical displays. Frequency Histograms The stem and leaf diagram is not practical for large data sets, so we need a different, purely graphical way to represent data. A frequency histogram is such a device. We will illustrate it using the same data set from the previous subsection. For the scores on the exam, it is natural to group the scores on the standard ten-point scale, and count the number of scores in each group. Thus there are two , seven scores in the , six in the , and so on. We then construct the diagram shown in Figure by drawing for each group, or class, a vertical bar whose length is the number of observations in that group. In our example, the bar labeled is units long, the bar labeled is units long, and so on. While the individual data values are lost, we know the number in each class. This number is called the frequency of the class, hence the name frequency histogram. Figure : Frequency Histogram The same procedure can be applied to any collection of numerical data. Observations are grouped into several classes and the frequency (the number of observations) of each class is noted. These classes are arranged and indicated in order on the horizontal axis (called the x-axis), and for each group a vertical bar, whose length is the number of observations in that group, is drawn. The resulting display is a frequency histogram for the data. The similarity in Figure and Figure is apparent, particularly if you imagine turning the stem and leaf diagram on its side by rotating it a quarter turn counterclockwise. In general, the definition of the classes in the frequency histogram is flexible. The general purpose of a frequency histogram is very much the same as that of a stem and leaf diagram, to provide a graphical display that gives a sense of data distribution across the range of values that appear. We will not discuss the process of constructing a histogram from data since in actual practice it is done automatically with statistical software or even handheld calculators. Relative Frequency Histograms In our example of the exam scores in a statistics class, five students scored in the . The number is the frequency of the group labeled   .  Since there are students in the entire statistics class, the proportion who scored in the is . The number , which could also be expressed as , or as , is the relative frequency of the group labeled   .  Every group (the , the , and so on) has a relative frequency. We can thus construct a diagram by drawing for each group, or class, a vertical bar whose length is the relative frequency of that group. For example, the bar for the will have length unit, not 8 8 0 6 3 7 3 30 100s 90s 80s 2.1.3 100 2 90 7 2.1.3 2.1.1 2.1.3  Definition 80s 5 80s 30 80s 5/30 5/30 0.1  . 1667 6  16.67% 80s 70s 80s 80s 5/30 5 ',\n",

It is exactly the same as the frequency histogram except that the vertical axis in the relative frequency histogram is not frequency but relative frequency. Figure : Relative Frequency Histogram The same procedure can be applied to any collection of numerical data. Classes are selected, the relative frequency of each class is noted, the classes are arranged and indicated in order on the horizontal axis, and for each class a vertical bar, whose length is the relative frequency of the class, is drawn. The resulting display is a relative frequency histogram for the data. A key point is that now if each vertical bar has width unit, then the total area of all the bars is or . Although the histograms in Figure and Figure have the same appearance, the relative frequency histogram is more important for us, and it will be relative frequency histograms that will be used repeatedly to represent data in this text. To see why this is so, reflect on what it is that you are actually seeing in the diagrams that quickly and effectively communicates information to you about the data. It is the relative sizes of the bars. The bar labeled     in either figure takes up of the total area of all the bars, and although we may not think of this consciously, we perceive the proportion in the figures, indicating that a third of the grades were in the . The relative frequency histogram is important because the labeling on the vertical axis reflects what is important visually: the relative sizes of the bars. Figure : Sample Size and Relative Frequency Histogram When the size n of a sample is small only a few classes can be used in constructing a relative frequency histogram. Such a histogram might look something like the one in panel (a) of Figure . If the sample size were increased, then more classes could be used in constructing a relative frequency histogram and the vertical bars of the resulting histogram would be finer, as indicated in panel (b) of Figure . For a very large sample the relative frequency histogram would look very fine, like the one 2.1.4 2.1.4 1 1 100% 2.1.3 2.1.4 70s 1/3 1/3 70s 2.1.5 2.1.5 n 2.1.5 ',\n",

If the sample size were to increase indefinitely then the corresponding relative frequency histogram would be so fine that it would look like a smooth curve, such as the one in panel (d) of Figure . Figure : A Very Fine Relative Frequency Histogram It is common in statistics to represent a population or a very large data set by a smooth curve. It is good to keep in mind that such a curve is actually just a very fine relative frequency histogram in which the exceedingly narrow vertical bars have disappeared. Because the area of each such vertical bar is the proportion of the data that lies in the interval of numbers over which that bar stands, this means that for any two numbers and , the proportion of the data that lies between the two numbers and is the area under the curve that is above the interval ( ) in the horizontal axis. This is the area shown in Figure . In particular the total area under the curve is , or . Graphical representations of large data sets provide a quick overview of the nature of the data. A population or a very large data set may be represented by a smooth curve. This curve is a very fine relative frequency histogram in which the exceedingly narrow vertical bars have been omitted. When a curve derived from a relative frequency histogram is used to describe a data set, the proportion of data with values between two numbers and is the area under the curve between and , as illustrated in Figure .

To learn the meaning of each of three measures of the center of a data set the mean, the median, and the mode and how to compute each one. This section is be titled  three kinds of averages  because any kind of average could be used to answer the question \"where is the center of the data?\". We will see that the nature of the data set, as indicated by a relative frequency histogram, will determine what constitutes a good answer. Different shapes of the histogram call for different measures of central location. The Mean The first measure of central location is the usual  average  that is familiar to everyone: add up all the values, then divide by the number of values. Before writing a formula for the mean let us introduce some handy mathematical notation. The Greek letter , pronounced \"sigma\", is a handy mathematical shorthand that stands for \"add up all the values\" or \"sum\". For example means \"add up all the values of \", and means \"add up all the values of \". In these expressions usually stands for a value of the data, so stands for \"the sum of all the data values\" and means \"the sum of the squares of all the data values\". stands for the sample size, the number of data values. An example will help make this clear. Find , , and for the data: Solution Using these handy notations it\\'s easy to write a formula defining the mean of a sample. The sample mean of a set of sample data values is the number defined by the formula Find the mean of the following sample data: , , , Solution This is a application of Equation :  Learning Objectives  notations: \"sum\" and \"sample size\"   n    x x  x2 x2 x  x  x2 n  Example 2.2.1 n  x  x2  (x  1)2 1, 3, 4 n  x  x2  (x  1)2 = = = = 3 because there are three data values 1 +3 +4 = 8 + + = 1 +9 +16 = 26 12 32 42 + + = + + = 13 (1  1)2 (3  1)2 (4  1)2 02 22 32 x   Definition: Sample Mean n x  = x   x n (2.2.1)  Example 2.2.2 2  1 0 2 2.2.1 = = = = 0.75 x   x n 2 +( 1)+0 +2 4 3 4 ',\n",
       " 'A random sample of ten students is taken from the student body of a college and their GPAs are recorded as follows: Find the mean. Solution This is a application of Equation : A random sample of women beyond child-bearing age gave the following data, where is the number of children and is the frequency, or the number of times it occurred in the data set. Find the sample mean. Solution In this example the data are presented by means of a data frequency table, introduced in Chapter 1. Each number in the first line of the table is a number that appears in the data set; the number below it is how many times it occurs. Thus the value is observed three times, that is, three of the measurements in the data set are , the value is observed six times, and so on. In the context of the problem this means that three women in the sample have had no children, six have had exactly one child, and so on. The explicit list of all the observations in this data set is therefore: The sample size can be read directly from the table, without first listing the entire data set, as the sum of the frequencies: . The sample mean can be computed directly from the table as well: In the examples above the data sets were described as samples. Therefore the means were sample means . If the data come from a census, so that there is a measurement for every element of the population, then the mean is calculated by exactly the same process of summing all the measurements and dividing by how many of them there are, but it is now the population mean and is denoted by , the lower case Greek letter mu. The population mean of a set of population data is the number defined by the formula: The mean of two numbers is the number that is halfway between them. For example, the average of the numbers and is , which is units above and units below . In this sense the average is the  center  of the data set . For larger data sets the mean can similarly be regarded as the  center  of the data. The Median To see why another concept of average is needed, consider the following situation. Suppose we are interested in the average yearly income of employees at a large corporation. We take a random sample of seven employees, obtaining the sample data (rounded to  Example 2.2.3 1.90, 3.00, 2.53, 3.71, 2.12, 1.76, 2.71, 1.39, 4.00, 3.33 2.2.1 = = = = 2.645 x   x n 1.90 +3.00 +2.53 +3.71 +2.12 +1.76 +2.71 +1.39 +4.00 +3.33 10 26.45 10  Example 2.2.4 19 x f x f 0 3 1 6 2 6 3 3 4 1 0 0 1 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4 n = 3 +6 +6 +3 +1 = 19 = = = = 1.6316 x   x n 0  3 +1  6 +2  6 +3  3 +4  1 19 31 19 x     Definition: Population Mean N     = .  x N 5 17 (5 +17) 2 = 11 6 5 6 17 11 {5, 17} ',\n",
       " 'the nearest hundred dollars, and expressed in thousands of dollars). The mean (rounded to one decimal place) is , but the statement  the average income of employees at this corporation is   is surely misleading. It is approximately twice what six of the seven employees in the sample make and is nowhere near what any of them makes. It is easy to see what went wrong: the presence of the one executive in the sample, whose salary is so large compared to everyone else s, caused the numerator in the formula for the sample mean to be far too large, pulling the mean far to the right of where we think that the average  ought  to be, namely around or . The number in our data set is called an outlier, a number that is far removed from most or all of the remaining measurements. Many times an outlier is the result of some sort of error, but not always, as is the case here. We would get a better measure of the  center  of the data if we were to arrange the data in numerical order: then select the middle number in the list, in this case . The result is called the median of the data set, and has the property that roughly half of the measurements are larger than it is, and roughly half are smaller. In this sense it locates the center of the data. If there are an even number of measurements in the data set, then there will be two middle elements when all are lined up in order, so we take the mean of the middle two as the median. Thus we have the following definition. The sample median of a set of sample data for which there are an odd number of measurements is the middle measurement when the data are arranged in numerical order. The sample median of a set of sample data for which there are an even number of measurements, is the mean of the two middle measurements when the data are arranged in numerical order. The population median is defined in the same way as the sample median except for the entire population. The median is a value that divides the observations in a data set so that of the data are on its left and the other on its right. In accordance with Figure , therefore, in the curve that represents the distribution of the data, a vertical line drawn at the median divides the area in two, area ( of the total area ) to the left and area ( of the total area ) to the right, as shown in Figure . In our income example the median, , clearly gave a much better measure of the middle of the data set than did the mean . This is typical for situations in which the distribution is skewed. (Skewness and symmetry of distributions are discussed at the end of this subsection.)

In the last example it is important to note that we could have computed the median directly from the frequency table, without first explicitly listing all the observations in the data set. We already saw in Example how to find the number of observations directly from the frequencies listed in the table . Thus the median is the tenth observation. The second line of the table in Example shows that when the data are listed in order there will be three followed by six , so the tenth observation, the median, is . The relationship between the mean and the median for several common shapes of distributions is shown in Figure . The distributions in panels (a) and (b) are said to be symmetric because of the symmetry that they exhibit. The distributions in the remaining two panels are said to be skewed. In each distribution we have drawn a vertical line that divides the area under the curve in half, which in accordance with Figure is located at the median. The following facts are true in general: When the distribution is symmetric, as in panels (a) and (b) of Figure , the mean and the median are equal. When the distribution is as shown in panel (c), it is said to be skewed right. The mean has been pulled to the right of the median by the long  right tail  of the distribution, the few relatively large data values. When the distribution is as shown in panel (d), it is said to be skewed left.

On a relative frequency histogram, the highest point of the histogram corresponds to the mode of the data set. Figure illustrates the mode.

To learn how to compute three measures of the variability of a data set: the range, the variance, and the standard deviation.

Nevertheless a glance at the figure shows that they are markedly different. In Data Set I the measurements vary only slightly from the center, while for Data Set II the measurements vary greatly. Just as we have attached numbers to a data set to locate its center, we now wish to associate to each data set numbers that measure quantitatively how the data either scatter away from the center or cluster close to it. These new quantities are called measures of variability, and we will discuss three of them. Figure : Dot Plots of Data Sets The Range First we discuss the simplest measure of variability. The range of a data set is difference between its largest and smallest values where is the largest measurement in the data set and is the smallest. Find the range of each data set in Table . Solution For Data Set I the maximum is and the minimum is , so the range is . For Data Set II the maximum is and the minimum is , so the range is . The range is a measure of variability because it indicates the size of the interval over which the data points are distributed. A smaller range indicates less variability (less dispersion) among the data, whereas a larger range indicates the opposite.

For example, if the units in the data set were inches, the new units would be inches squared, or square inches. It is thus primarily of theoretical importance and will not be considered further in this text, except in passing. If the data set comprises the whole population, then the population standard deviation, denoted (the lower case Greek letter sigma), and its square, the population variance , are defined as follows. The variability of a set of population data is measured by the population variance and its square root, the population standard deviation where is the population mean as defined above. Note that the denominator in the fraction is the full number of observations, not that number reduced by one, as is the case with the sample standard deviation. Since most data sets are samples, we will always work with the sample standard deviation and variance. Finally, in many real-life situations the most important statistical issues have to do with comparing the means and standard deviations of two data sets.
